Frontend Developer Skills Assestment Test
This test is for any frontend developer that wants to work with PixelStorm Web Development team. It will test your basic understanding of:

* HTML & Bootstrap templates
* Scss
* git set up and usage
* Build tools
* Understanding of requests from management

After you complete a step, it is required that you commit your code and push. This means, when you’ve done a change, please make a commit and push.

At the end of the 15 steps, we should have access to the repository that you have created on your own private repository on github and with at least 10 commits.

This exercise should take you between 1-2 hour to complete. This test is part of your interview process. The questions are written in a way that the client will communicate problems to us.

Please limit yourself to 2 hours maximum for this exercise.

### Step 1
Duplicate this repository and upload it to your own github account. E.g clone the repository and add a new remote origin that is on your github account.

https://github.com/pixelstorm/frontend_skills_test.git

### Step 2
We need read access to review your code.

Give this user read access to the account:

pixelstorm

### Step 3
Get this repository working on your local environment to start fixing issues

### Step 4
There is an issue with the rendering of the website. Please fix the issue so that it renders the CSS properly.



### Step 5
The header area of the website that has a background image is too short. We need to make it bigger and higher. Please make it higher. We think it should be at least 400px high.

### Step 6
The content area of the website on desktop and tablet layouts is too wide. If goes all the way across the screen making it very hard to read. Please decrease the content column width to 8 columns wide on desktop and centre the column.

Please make it 10 columns on tablet layout and centre the content.

### Step 7
The footer area has some social links in the footer. Please make these inline.

### Step 8
In the footer area where there are the social links, Twitter, Facebook and Github, please remove Github and add in two more social network icons of your choice and make the icons display inline next to each other.

### Step 9
The hover effects on this website are boring. Please add a transition in the hover states. Add a fadin color effect on hover (from grey to green).

### Step 10
Let’s add some cool fonts to the website. Please choose a Google font of your choice for all the headings of the site.

### Step 11
Change the default hover colour across the website to the same colour lime color that can be found on the panel with the .fullscreen.cta_panel class on http://pxsold.au.ngrok.io/ homepage

### Step 12
Grab the logo and add it to the the template that you are working on in the logo area where it currently says “PXS Web Development” in plain text. Make sure it acts as a home button when clicked.

### Step 13
Change the header image on the home page to something of your choice.

### Step 14
Make sure that the header image stretches to fix the containing div. The client wants to see all of the image.

### Step 15
Add a parallax effect to the header image

Additional Step if Required: WordPress Developer
Please contact Paula before continuing at this point.

If you’re wanting to be a WordPress Developer with us, at this point you will need to convert the theme into a working WordPress blog with the wp posts feeding onto the homepage. Ensure to use an accompanying child theme.

We estimate it will take 1-2 hours. Commit logs are also required as you build the theme/template to see how you progress through the build.

Please provide a database dump along with an wp-admin username: pxswebdev and password: pxswebdev123

Please limit yourself to 2 hours maximum for this exercise.

We are limiting the payment for this part of the test to 2 hours.
